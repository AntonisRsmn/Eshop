# E‑shop Template

**E‑shop Template** is a clean, responsive front‑end template for a minimalistic e‑commerce storefront—entirely front‑end logic (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), hosted as a static page (e.g. via GitHub Pages).

## 🌟 Overview

This template provides a modern, fully responsive layout suitable for generic online stores:

- Product catalog listing with images, prices, and add-to-cart buttons  
- Responsive design optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop  
- Lightweight, static setup—no database or backend required  
- Ideal for prototyping, MVPs, or as a front‑end starting point for e‑commerce projects

You can see a working version at **[Live Demo](https://antonisrsmn.github.io/Eshop-Template/)**.

## 🚀 Features

- **Responsive grid** for product listings  
- **Interactive cart UI** using JavaScript (client-side only)  
- **Search/filter bar** for products  
- **Simple checkout mock-up** (front‑end only, no actual payment integration)  
- Clean and well-organized HTML/CSS structure  
- Easily modifiable SCSS or CSS styles for theming
